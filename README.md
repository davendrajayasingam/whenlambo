## Project: When Lambo?

Assume you have some USDT and youâ€™d like to buy some BTC and ETH. You would like to know whether it is cheaper to buy on Binance, Kucoin, Kraken, or Bybit. Write a web app that displays the buy and sell prices of BTC and ETH (depending on which URL path we are on i.e. yourapp.com/btc or yourapp.com/eth), then display the name of the exchange of which it is cheapest to buy said coins.

You only have to choose 2 out of 4 of the exchanges (Binance, Kucoin, Kraken, or Bybit) for this task. To clarify, you are only looking at USDT denominated spot prices, not futures. Bonus points if your application updates the page and its verdict live according to every latest price change.
